### flex <hr>
This part contains different icons in a flex which are wrapped properly. So that it adjusts its size according to the Screen size. This flex box shows responsiveness.

### Timer <hr>
The timer will starts running when you start the game by flip any of the cards. If you match all the pairs before time gets exceeded, you win. Else, after the timer runs out, it shows an alert notification that timer has been exceeded. This game also counts the number of flips you make to match the icons. There is a button to refresh, which let you shuffle all the cards and starts the game again.
